# MidiTouch

This software allows you to control musical softwares like Ableton or FL Studio with your Wacom tablet. 

## Requirements

In order to make this software work you will need a virtual midi loopback interface installed on your computer, I recommend using **loopmidi**.
You will also need to **disable all multi-touch features** of wacom tablet and **disable HID mouse driver** on Windows device manager.

## Libraries and licencing

this software uses two external libraries:
  * first one is NAudio (for midi interfacing), you can find the licence of this library on NAudio_LICENCE.md.
  * second one is Wacom feel multi-touch API, you can find the licence on WacomMTDN_LICENCE.md
